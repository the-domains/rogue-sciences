Rogue Sciences will be about visual invention. Seeing complexity on its own terms. It's a place where we get to think about deep time, orders of magnitude and the beauty of the universe. We will drink deep thoughts on scientific phenomena for the purpose of shock and awe possibly followed by understanding.
